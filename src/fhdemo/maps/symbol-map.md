# Symbol Map (`FHDEMO.EXE`)

This file is a placeholder map for labeling routines discovered during analysis.
Addresses are virtual addresses.

| Address | Provisional Name | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `0x00465520` | `entrypoint` | placeholder | Entry point from `objdump -f`. |
| `0x00465520` | `sub_00465520` | placeholder | First routine at entrypoint; refine once disassembled. |
| `0x????????` | `sub_XXXXXXXX` | placeholder | Add as new routines are identified. |

## TODO: Name conventions
- Prefer descriptive names once behavior is understood.
- Keep provisional labels aligned with disassembler defaults (e.g., `sub_XXXXXXXX`).

# Structure Map (`FHDEMO.EXE`)

Template for documenting data structures as they are identified.
Fill in offsets and types as field layouts become clear.

| Structure | Size | Fields | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `struct_UNKNOWN_0` | `0x??` | `offset: type name` | placeholder | Replace with real structure names and offsets. |

## Field format guidance
- Use `0x`-prefixed offsets.
- Track bitfields explicitly where possible.
- Note source routines or file references that reveal the structure.

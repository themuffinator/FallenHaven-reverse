-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This file contains the latest information available about the 
Fallen Haven demo. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This demo is designed to give you a feel for some of Fallen Haven's
gameplay.  It will allow you to fight battles in a limited scenario.

The full game has multiple scenarios, each much larger than the demo.
You can also build and utilize many more unit types in the full game, 
as well as research new technological advances and build new
structures.


HISTORY OF FALLEN HAVEN

The planet New Haven was supposed to be a paradise, an idyllic, 
peaceful new home for colonists from Old Earth. But that was before 
the wars broke out, before the provinces turned on one another ... 
and before the aliens arrived ...
                                        
Unwittingly, Earth scientists awoke the sleepng giant of the Tauran 
war machine. The same deep-space probes that first discovered the 
planet of New Haven also alerted the aliens. Now the Taurans, warlike 
aliens previously unknown to humankind, have mounted an invasion, 
descending upon New Haven with one goal: total conquest

TIPS & STRATEGIES

Do not leave any province undefended. The constant threat of orbital 
attacks means that all provinces must be protected.

Be careful with your dropships - in the demo you cannot build 
additional ones. Keep them out of harms way! In the demo, you cannot
repair damaged dropship nor build new ones.

Plan your attacks so that you make your first shots count.
